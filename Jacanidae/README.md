# Jacanidae


### Why the name ?

As many of you know, I have a deep love for birds. All my project names are inspired by birds observed near Chilika, Odisha.

This project is named after the graceful ପାନି କୁଳିକା (Pāni Kuḷikā), more charmingly known as lily trotters. These delightful birds are nature’s acrobats, dancing effortlessly across floating lilies and water plants. 

Just like them, I hope this project treads gracefully in its domain. 🌿✨
